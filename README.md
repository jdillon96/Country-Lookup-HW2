# Country Lookup

A simple, static webapp that uses React and an API to deliver information about a certain country.

It accomplishes this by having the user select a country through a dropdown menu.

It will then display information about that countries' government, geography, culture, and economy.

Note: Some countries may have more or less information then others, due to the API not containing current information on certain countries because of political/logistical issues gathering data.
